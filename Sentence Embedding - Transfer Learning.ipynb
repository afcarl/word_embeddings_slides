       "'anarchism originated as a term of abuse first used against early working class radicals including the diggers of the english revolution and the sans culottes of the french revolution whilst the term is still used in a pejorative way to describe any act that used violent means to destroy the organization of society it has also been taken up as a positive label by self defined anarchists the word anarchism is derived from the greek without archons ruler chief king anarchism as a political philosophy is the belief that rulers are unnecessary and should be abolished although there are differing interpretations of what this means anarchism also refers to related social movements that advocate the elimination of authoritarian institutions particularly the state the word anarchy as most anarchists use it does not imply chaos nihilism or anomie but rather a harmonious anti authoritarian society in place of what are regarded as authoritarian political structures and coercive economic institutions anarchists advocate social relations based upon voluntary association of autonomous individuals mutual aid and self governance while anarchism is most easily defined by what it is against anarchists also offer positive visions of what they believe to be a truly free society however ideas about how an anarchist society might work vary considerably especially with respect to economics there is also disagreement about how a free society might be brought about origins and predecessors kropotkin and others argue that before recorded history human society was organized on anarchist principles most anthropologists follow kropotkin and engels in believing that hunter gatherer bands were egalitarian and lacked division of labour accumulated wealth or decreed law and had equal access to resources william godwin anarchists including the the anarchy organisation and rothbard find anarchist attitudes in taoism from ancient china kropotkin found similar ideas in stoic zeno of citium according to kropotkin zeno repudiated the omnipotence of the state its intervention and regimentation and proclaimed the sovereignty of the moral law of the individual the anabaptists of one six th century europe are sometimes considered to be religious forerunners of modern anarchism bertrand russell in his history of western philosophy writes that the anabaptists repudiated all law since they held that the good man will be guided at every moment by the holy spirit from this premise they arrive at communism the diggers or true levellers were an early communistic movement during the time of the english civil war and are considered by some as forerunners of modern anarchism in the modern era the first to use the term to mean something other than chaos was louis armand baron de lahontan in his nouveaux voyages dans l am rique septentrionale one seven zero three where he described the indigenous american society which had no state laws prisons priests or private property as being in anarchy russell means a libertarian and leader in the american indian movement has repeatedly stated that he is an anarchist and so are all his ancestors in one seven nine three in the thick of the french revolution william godwin published an enquiry concerning political justice although godwin did not use the word anarchism many later anarchists have regarded this book as the first major anarchist text and godwin as the founder of philosophical anarchism but at this point no anarchist movement yet existed and the term anarchiste was known mainly as an insult hurled by the bourgeois girondins at more radical elements in the french revolution the first self labelled anarchist pierre joseph proudhon it is commonly held that it wasn t until pierre joseph proudhon published what is property in one eight four zero that the term anarchist was adopted as a self description it is for this reason that some claim proudhon as the founder of modern anarchist theory in what is property proudhon answers with the famous accusation property is theft in this work he opposed the institution of decreed property propri t where owners have complete rights to use and abuse their property as they wish such as exploiting workers for profit in its place proudhon supported what he called possession individuals can have limited rights to use resources capital and goods in accordance with principles of equality and justice proudhon s vision of anarchy which he called mutualism mutuellisme involved an exchange economy where individuals and groups could trade the products of their labor using labor notes which represented the amount of working time involved in production this would ensure that no one would profit from the labor of others workers could freely join together in co operative workshops an interest free bank would be set up to provide everyone with access to the means of production proudhon s ideas were influential within french working class movements and his followers were active in the revolution of one eight four eight in france proudhon s philosophy of property is complex it was developed in a number of works over his lifetime and there are differing interpretations of some of his ideas for more detailed discussion see here max stirner s egoism in his the ego and its own stirner argued that most commonly accepted social institutions including the notion of state property as a right natural rights in general and the very notion of society were mere illusions or ghosts in the mind saying of society that the individuals are its reality he advocated egoism and a form of amoralism in which individuals would unite in associations of egoists only when it was in their self interest to do so for him property simply comes about through might whoever knows how to take to defend the thing to him belongs property and what i have in my power that is my own so long as i assert myself as holder i am the proprietor of the thing stirner never called himself an anarchist he accepted only the label egoist nevertheless his ideas were influential on many individualistically inclined anarchists although interpretations of his thought are diverse american individualist anarchism benjamin tucker in one eight two five josiah warren had participated in a communitarian experiment headed by robert owen called new harmony which failed in a few years amidst much internal conflict warren blamed the community s failure on a lack of individual sovereignty and a lack of private property warren proceeded to organise experimenal anarchist communities which respected what he called the sovereignty of the individual at utopia and modern times in one eight three three warren wrote and published the peaceful revolutionist which some have noted to be the first anarchist periodical ever published benjamin tucker says that warren was the first man to expound and formulate the doctrine now known as anarchism liberty xiv december one nine zero zero one benjamin tucker became interested in anarchism through meeting josiah warren and william b greene he edited and published liberty from august one eight eight one to april one nine zero eight it is widely considered to be the finest individualist anarchist periodical ever issued in the english language tucker s conception of individualist anarchism incorporated the ideas of a variety of theorists greene s ideas on mutual banking warren s ideas on cost as the limit of price a heterodox variety of labour theory of value proudhon s market anarchism max stirner s egoism and herbert spencer s law of equal freedom tucker strongly supported the individual s right to own the product of his or her labour as private property and believed in a market economy for trading this property he argued that in a truly free market system without the state the abundance of competition would eliminate profits and ensure that all workers received the full value of their labor other one nine th century individualists included lysander spooner stephen pearl andrews and victor yarros the first international mikhail bakunin one eight one four one eight seven six in europe harsh reaction followed the revolutions of one eight four eight twenty years later in one eight six four the international workingmen s association sometimes called the first international united some diverse european revolutionary currents including anarchism due to its genuine links to active workers movements the international became signficiant from the start karl marx was a leading figure in the international he was elected to every succeeding general council of the association the first objections to marx came from the mutualists who opposed communism and statism shortly after mikhail bakunin and his followers joined in one eight six eight the first international became polarised into two camps with marx and bakunin as their respective figureheads the clearest difference between the camps was over strategy the anarchists around bakunin favoured in kropotkin s words direct economical struggle against capitalism without interfering in the political parliamentary agitation at that time marx and his followers focused on parliamentary activity bakunin characterised marx s ideas as authoritarian and predicted that if a marxist party gained to power its leaders would end up as bad as the ruling class they had fought against in one eight seven two the conflict climaxed with a final split between the two groups at the hague congress this is often cited as the origin of the conflict between anarchists and marxists from this moment the social democratic and libertarian currents of socialism had distinct organisations including rival internationals anarchist communism peter kropotkin proudhon and bakunin both opposed communism associating it with statism however in the one eight seven zero s many anarchists moved away from bakunin s economic thinking called collectivism and embraced communist concepts communists believed the means of production should be owned collectively and that goods be distributed by need not labor an early anarchist communist was joseph d jacque the first person to describe himself as libertarian unlike proudhon he argued that it is not the product of his or her labor that the worker has a right to but to the satisfaction of his or her needs whatever may be their nature he announced his ideas in his us published journal le libertaire one eight five eight one eight six one peter kropotkin often seen as the most important theorist outlined his economic ideas in the conquest of bread and fields factories and workshops he felt co operation is more beneficial than competition illustrated in nature in mutual aid a factor of evolution one eight nine seven subsequent anarchist communists include emma goldman and alexander berkman many in the anarcho syndicalist movements see below saw anarchist communism as their objective isaac puente s one nine three two comunismo libertario was adopted by the spanish cnt as its manifesto for a post revolutionary society some anarchists disliked merging communism with anarchism several individualist anarchists maintained that abolition of private property was not consistent with liberty for example benjamin tucker whilst professing respect for kropotkin and publishing his work described communist anarchism as pseudo anarchism propaganda of the deed johann most was an outspoken advocate of violence anarchists have often been portrayed as dangerous and violent due mainly to a number of high profile violent acts including riots assassinations insurrections and terrorism by some anarchists some revolutionaries of the late one nine th century encouraged acts of political violence such as bombings and the assassinations of heads of state to further anarchism such actions have sometimes been called propaganda by the deed one of the more outspoken advocates of this strategy was johann most who said the existing system will be quickest and most radically overthrown by the annihilation of its exponents therefore massacres of the enemies of the people must be set in motion most s preferred method of terrorism dynamite earned him the moniker dynamost however there is no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence in general mikhail bakunin and errico malatesta for example wrote of violence as a necessary and sometimes desirable force in revolutionary settings but at the same time they denounced acts of individual terrorism malatesta in on violence and bakunin when he refuted nechaev other anarchists sometimes identified as pacifist anarchists advocated complete nonviolence leo tolstoy whose philosophy is often viewed as a form of christian anarchism see below was a notable exponent of nonviolent resistance anarchism in the labour movement the red and black flag coming from the experience of anarchists in the labour movement is particularly associated with anarcho syndicalism anarcho syndicalism was an early two zero th century working class movement seeking to overthrow capitalism and the state to institute a worker controlled society the movement pursued industrial actions such as general strike as a primary strategy many anarcho syndicalists believed in anarchist communism though not all communists believed in syndicalism after the one eight seven one repression french anarchism reemerged influencing the bourses de travails of autonomous workers groups and trade unions from this movement the conf d ration g n rale du travail general confederation of work cgt was formed in one eight nine five as the first major anarcho syndicalist movement emile pataud and emile pouget s writing for the cgt saw libertarian communism developing from a general strike after one nine one four the cgt moved away from anarcho syndicalism due to the appeal of bolshevism french style syndicalism was a significant movement in europe prior to one nine two one and remained a significant movement in spain until the mid one nine four zero s the industrial workers of the world iww founded in one nine zero five in the us espoused unionism and sought a general strike to usher in a stateless society in one nine two three one zero zero zero zero zero members existed with the support of up to three zero zero zero zero zero though not explicitly anarchist they organized by rank and file democracy embodying a spirit of resistance that has inspired many anglophone syndicalists cnt propaganda from april two zero zero four reads don t let the politicians rule our lives you vote and they decide don t allow it unity action self management spanish anarchist trade union federations were formed in the one eight seven zero s one nine zero zero and one nine one zero the most successful was the confederaci n nacional del trabajo national confederation of labour cnt founded in one nine one zero prior to the one nine four zero s the cnt was the major force in spanish working class politics with a membership of one five eight million in one nine three four the cnt played a major role in the spanish civil war see also anarchism in spain syndicalists like ricardo flores mag n were key figures in the mexican revolution latin american anarchism was strongly influenced extending to the zapatista rebellion and the factory occupation movements in argentina in berlin in one nine two two the cnt was joined with the international workers association an anarcho syndicalist successor to the first international contemporary anarcho syndicalism continues as a minor force in many socities much smaller than in the one nine one zero s two zero s and three zero s the largest organised anarchist movement today is in spain in the form of the confederaci n general del trabajo and the cnt the cgt claims a paid up membership of six zero zero zero zero and received over a million votes in spanish syndical elections other active syndicalist movements include the us workers solidarity alliance and the uk solidarity federation the revolutionary industrial unionist industrial workers of the world also exists claiming two zero zero zero paid members contemporary critics of anarcho syndicalism and revolutionary industrial unionism claim that they are workerist and fail to deal with economic life outside work post leftist critics such as bob black claim anarcho syndicalism advocates oppressive social structures such as work and the workplace anarcho syndicalists in general uphold principles of workers solidarity direct action and self management the russian revolution the russian revolution of one nine one seven was a seismic event in the development of anarchism as a movement and as a philosophy anarchists participated alongside the bolsheviks in both february and october revolutions many anarchists initially supporting the bolshevik coup however the bolsheviks soon turned against the anarchists and other left wing opposition a conflict which culminated in the one nine one eight kronstadt rebellion anarchists in central russia were imprisoned or driven underground or joined the victorious bolsheviks in ukraine anarchists fought in the civil war against both whites and bolsheviks within the makhnovshchina peasant army led by nestor makhno expelled american anarchists emma goldman and alexander berkman before leaving russia were amongst those agitating in response to bolshevik policy and the suppression of the kronstadt uprising both wrote classic accounts of their experiences in russia aiming to expose the reality of bolshevik control for them bakunin s predictions about the consequences of marxist rule had proved all too true the victory of the bolsheviks in the october revolution and the resulting russian civil war did serious damage to anarchist movements internationally many workers and activists saw bolshevik success as setting an example communist parties grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements in france and the us for example the major syndicalist movements of the cgt and iww began to realign themselves away from anarchism and towards the communist international in paris the dielo truda group of russian anarchist exiles which included nestor makhno concluded that anarchists needed to develop new forms of organisation in response to the structures of bolshevism their one nine two six manifesto known as the organisational platform of the libertarian communists was supported by some communist anarchists though opposed by many others the platform continues to inspire some contemporary anarchist groups who believe in an anarchist movement organised around its principles of theoretical unity tactical unity collective responsibility and federalism platformist groups today include the workers solidarity movement in ireland the uk s anarchist federation and the late north eastern federation of anarchist communists in the northeastern united states and bordering canada the fight against fascism spain one nine three six members of the cnt construct armoured cars to fight against the fascists in one of the collectivised factories in the one nine two zero s and one nine three zero s the familiar dynamics of anarchism s conflict with the state were transformed by the rise of fascism in europe in many cases european anarchists faced difficult choices should they join in popular fronts with reformist democrats and soviet led communists against a common fascist enemy luigi fabbri an exile from italian fascism was amongst those arguing that fascism was something different fascism is not just another form of government which like all others uses violence it is the most authoritarian and the most violent form of government imaginable it represents the utmost glorification of the theory and practice of the principle of authority in france where the fascists came close to insurrection in the february one nine three four riots anarchists divided over a united front policy in spain the cnt initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance and abstention by cnt supporters led to a right wing election victory but in one nine three six the cnt changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power months later the ruling class responded with an attempted coup and the spanish civil war one nine three six three nine was underway in reponse to the army rebellion an anarchist inspired movement of peasants and workers supported by armed militias took control of the major city of barcelona and of large areas of rural spain where they collectivized the land but even before the eventual fascist victory in one nine three nine the anarchists were losing ground in a bitter struggle with the stalinists the cnt leadership often appeared confused and divided with some members controversially entering the government stalinist led troops suppressed the collectives and persecuted both dissident marxists and anarchists since the late one nine seven zero s anarchists have been involved in fighting the rise of neo fascist groups in germany and the united kingdom some anarchists worked within militant anti fascist groups alongside members of the marxist left they advocated directly combating fascists with physical force rather than relying on the state since the late one nine nine zero s a similar tendency has developed within us anarchism see also anti racist action us anti fascist action uk antifa religious anarchism leo tolstoy one eight two eight one nine one zero most anarchist culture tends to be secular if not outright anti religious however the combination of religious social conscience historical religiousity amongst oppressed social classes and the compatibility of some interpretations of religious traditions with anarchism has resulted in religious anarchism christian anarchists believe that there is no higher authority than god and oppose earthly authority such as government and established churches they believe that jesus teachings were clearly anarchistic but were corrupted when christianity was declared the official religion of rome christian anarchists who follow jesus directive to turn the other cheek are strict pacifists the most famous advocate of christian anarchism was leo tolstoy author of the kingdom of god is within you who called for a society based on compassion nonviolent principles and freedom christian anarchists tend to form experimental communities they also occasionally resist taxation many christian anarchists are vegetarian or vegan christian anarchy can be said to have roots as old as the religion s birth as the early church exhibits many anarchistic tendencies such as communal goods and wealth by aiming to obey utterly certain of the bible s teachings certain anabaptist groups of sixteenth century europe attempted to emulate the early church s social economic organisation and philosophy by regarding it as the only social structure capable of true obediance to jesus teachings and utterly rejected in theory all earthly hierarchies and authority and indeed non anabaptists in general and violence as ungodly such groups for example the hutterites typically went from initially anarchistic beginnings to as their movements stabalised more authoritarian social models chinese anarchism was most influential in the one nine two zero s strands of chinese anarchism included tai xu s buddhist anarchism which was influenced by tolstoy and the well field system neopaganism with its focus on the environment and equality along with its often decentralized nature has lead to a number of neopagan anarchists one of the most prominent is starhawk who writes extensively about both spirituality and activism anarchism and feminism emma goldman early french feminists such as jenny d h ricourt and juliette adam criticised the mysogyny in the anarchism of proudhon during the one eight five zero s anarcha feminism is a kind of radical feminism that espouses the belief that patriarchy is a fundamental problem in society while anarchist feminism has existed for more than a hundred years its explicit formulation as anarcha feminism dates back to the early seven zero s during the second wave feminist movement anarcha feminism views patriarchy as the first manifestation of hierarchy in human history thus the first form of oppression occurred in the dominance of male over female anarcha feminists then conclude that if feminists are against patriarchy they must also be against all forms of hierarchy and therefore must reject the authoritarian nature of the state and capitalism anarcho primitivists see the creation of gender roles and patriarchy a creation of the start of civilization and therefore consider primitivism to also be an anarchist school of thought that addresses feminist concerns eco feminism is often considered a feminist variant of green anarchist feminist thought anarcha feminism is most often associated with early two zero th century authors and theorists such as emma goldman and voltairine de cleyre although even early first wave feminist mary wollstonecraft held proto anarchist views and william godwin is often considered a feminist anarchist precursor it should be noted that goldman and de cleyre though they both opposed the state had opposing philosophies as de cleyre explains miss goldman is a communist i am an individualist she wishes to destroy the right of property i wish to assert it i make my war upon privilege and authority whereby the right of property the true right in that which is proper to the individual is annihilated she believes that co operation would entirely supplant competition i hold that competition in one form or another will always exist and that it is highly desirable it should in the spanish civil war an anarcha feminist group free women organized to defend both anarchist and feminist ideas in the modern day anarchist movement many anarchists male or female consider themselves feminists and anarcha feminist ideas are growing the publishing of quiet rumors an anarcha feminist reader has helped to spread various kinds of anti authoritarian and anarchist feminist ideas to the broader movement wendy mcelroy has popularized an individualist anarchism take on feminism in her books articles and individualist feminist website anarcho capitalism murray rothbard one nine two six one nine nine five anarcho capitalism is a predominantly united states based theoretical tradition that desires a stateless society with the economic system of free market capitalism unlike other branches of anarchism it does not oppose profit or capitalism consequently most anarchists do not recognise anarcho capitalism as a form of anarchism murray rothbard s synthesis of classical liberalism and austrian economics was germinal for the development of contemporary anarcho capitalist theory he defines anarcho capitalism in terms of the non aggression principle based on the concept of natural law competiting theorists use egoism utilitarianism used by david friedman or contractarianism used by jan narveson some minarchists such as ayn rand robert nozick and robert a heinlein have influenced anarcho capitalism some anarcho capitalists along with some right wing libertarian historians such as david hart and ralph raico considered similar philosophies existing prior to rothbard to be anarcho capitalist such as those of gustave de molinari and auberon herbert opponents of anarcho capitalists dispute these claims the place of anarcho capitalism within anarchism and indeed whether it is a form of anarchism at all is highly controversial for more on this debate see anarchism and anarcho capitalism anarchism and the environment since the late one nine seven zero s anarchists in anglophone and european countries have been taking action for the natural environment eco anarchists or green anarchists believe in deep ecology this is a worldview that embraces biodiversity and sustainability eco anarchists often use direct action against what they see as earth destroying institutions of particular importance is the earth first movement that takes action such as tree sitting another important component is ecofeminism which sees the domination of nature as a metaphor for the domination of women green anarchism also involves a critique of industrial capitalism and for some green anarchists civilization itself primitivism is a predominantly western philosophy that advocates a return to a pre industrial and usually pre agricultural society it develops a critique of industrial civilization in this critique technology and development have alienated people from the natural world this philosophy develops themes present in the political action of the luddites and the writings of jean jacques rousseau primitivism developed in the context of the reclaim the streets earth first and the earth liberation front movements john zerzan wrote that civilization not just the state would need to fall for anarchy to be achieved anarcho primitivists point to the anti authoritarian nature of many primitive or hunter gatherer societies throughout the world s history as examples of anarchist societies other branches and offshoots anarchism generates many eclectic and syncretic philosophies and movements since the western social formet in the one nine six zero s and one nine seven zero s a number new of movements and schools have appeared most of these stances are limited to even smaller numbers than the schools and movements listed above hakim bey post left anarchy post left anarchy also called egoist anarchism seeks to distance itself from the traditional left communists liberals social democrats etc and to escape the confines of ideology in general post leftists argue that anarchism has been weakened by its long attachment to contrary leftist movements and single issue causes anti war anti nuclear etc it calls for a synthesis of anarchist thought and a specifically anti authoritarian revolutionary movement outside of the leftist milieu it often focuses on the individual rather than speaking in terms of class or other broad generalizations and shuns organizational tendencies in favor of the complete absence of explicit hierarchy important groups and individuals associated with post left anarchy include crimethinc the magazine anarchy a journal of desire armed and its editor jason mcquinn bob black hakim bey and others for more information see infoshop org s anarchy after leftism section and the post left section on anarchism ws see also post left anarchy post structuralism the term postanarchism was originated by saul newman first receiving popular attention in his book from bakunin to lacan to refer to a theoretical move towards a synthesis of classical anarchist theory and poststructuralist thought subsequent to newman s use of the term however it has taken on a life of its own and a wide range of ideas including autonomism post left anarchy situationism post colonialism and zapatismo by its very nature post anarchism rejects the idea that it should be a coherent set of doctrines and beliefs as such it is difficult if not impossible to state with any degree of certainty who should or shouldn t be grouped under the rubric nonetheless key thinkers associated with post anarchism include saul newman todd may gilles deleuze and f lix guattari external reference postanarchism clearinghouse see also post anarchism insurrectionary anarchism insurrectionary anarchism is a form of revolutionary anarchism critical of formal anarchist labor unions and federations insurrectionary anarchists advocate informal organization including small affinity groups carrying out acts of resistance in various struggles and mass organizations called base structures which can include exploited individuals who are not anarchists proponents include wolfi landstreicher and alfredo m bonanno author of works including armed joy and the anarchist tension this tendency is represented in the us in magazines such as willful disobedience and killing king abacus see also insurrectionary anarchism small a anarchism small a anarchism is a term used in two different but not unconnected contexts dave neal posited the term in opposition to big a anarchism in the article anarchism ideology or methodology while big a anarchism referred to ideological anarchists small a anarchism was applied to their methodological counterparts those who viewed anarchism as a way of acting or a historical tendency against illegitimate authority as an anti ideological position small a anarchism shares some similarities with post left anarchy david graeber and andrej grubacic offer an alternative use of the term applying it to groups and movements organising according to or acting in a manner consistent with anarchist principles of decentralisation voluntary association mutual aid the network model and crucially the rejection of any idea that the end justifies the means let alone that the business of a revolutionary is to seize state power and then begin imposing one s vision at the point of a gun other issues conceptions of an anarchist society many political philosophers justify support of the state as a means of regulating violence so that the destruction caused by human conflict is minimized and fair relationships are established anarchists argue that pursuit of these ends does not justify the establishment of a state many argue that the state is incompatible with those goals and the cause of chaos violence and war anarchists argue that the state helps to create a monopoly on violence and uses violence to advance elite interests much effort has been dedicated to explaining how anarchist societies would handle criminality see also anarchism and society civil rights and cultural sovereignty black anarchism opposes the existence of a state capitalism and subjugation and domination of people of color and favors a non hierarchical organization of society theorists include ashanti alston lorenzo komboa ervin and sam mbah anarchist people of color was created as a forum for non caucasian anarchists to express their thoughts about racial issues within the anarchist movement particularly within the united states national anarchism is a political view which seeks to unite cultural or ethnic preservation with anarchist views its adherents propose that those preventing ethnic groups or races from living in separate autonomous groupings should be resisted anti racist action is not an anarchist group but many anarchists are involved it focuses on publicly confronting racist agitators the zapatista movement of chiapas mexico is a cultural sovereignty group with some anarchist proclivities neocolonialism and globalization nearly all anarchists oppose neocolonialism as an attempt to use economic coercion on a global scale carried out through state institutions such as the world bank world trade organization group of eight and the world economic forum globalization is an ambiguous term that has different meanings to different anarchist factions most anarchists use the term to mean neocolonialism and or cultural imperialism which they may see as related many are active in the anti globalization movement others particularly anarcho capitalists use globalization to mean the worldwide expansion of the division of labor and trade which they see as beneficial so long as governments do not intervene parallel structures many anarchists try to set up alternatives to state supported institutions and outposts such as food not bombs infoshops educational systems such as home schooling neighborhood mediation arbitration groups and so on the idea is to create the structures for a new anti authoritarian society in the shell of the old authoritarian one technology recent technological developments have made the anarchist cause both easier to advance and more conceivable to people many people use the internet to form on line communities intellectual property is undermined and a gift culture supported by sharing music files open source programming and the free software movement these cyber communities include the gnu linux indymedia and wiki some anarchists see information technology as the best weapon to defeat authoritarianism some even think the information age makes eventual anarchy inevitable see also crypto anarchism and cypherpunk pacifism some anarchists consider pacifism opposition to war to be inherent in their philosophy anarcho pacifists take it further and follow leo tolstoy s belief in non violence anarchists see war as an activity in which the state seeks to gain and consolidate power both domestically and in foreign lands and subscribe to randolph bourne s view that war is the health of the state a lot of anarchist activity has been anti war based parliamentarianism in general terms the anarchist ethos opposes voting in elections because voting amounts to condoning the state voluntaryism is an anarchist school of thought which emphasizes tending your own garden and neither ballots nor bullets the anarchist case against voting is explained in the ethics of voting by george h smith also see voting anarchists an oxymoron or what by joe peacott and writings by fred woodworth sectarianism most anarchist schools of thought are to some degree sectarian there is often a difference of opinion within each school about how to react to or interact with other schools some such as panarchists believe that it is possible for a variety of modes of social life to coexist and compete some anarchists view opposing schools as a social impossibility and resist interaction others see opportunities for coalition building or at least temporary alliances for specific purposes see anarchism without adjectives criticisms of anarchism main article criticisms of anarchism violence since anarchism has often been associated with violence and destruction some people have seen it as being too violent on the other hand hand frederick engels criticsed anarchists for not being violent enough a revolution is certainly the most authoritarian thing there is it is the act whereby one part of the population imposes its will upon the other part by means of rifles bayonets and cannon authoritarian means if such there be at all and if the victorious party does not want to have fought in vain it must maintain this rule by means of the terror which its arms inspire in the reactionists would the paris commune have lasted a single day if it had not made use of this authority of the armed people against the bourgeois utopianism anarchism is often criticised as unfeasible or plain utopian even by many who agree that it s a nice idea in principle for example carl landauer in his book european socialism criticizes anarchism as being unrealistically utopian and holds that government is a lesser evil than a society without repressive force he holds that the belief that ill intentions will cease if repressive force disappears is an absurdity however it must be noted that not all anarchists have such a utopian view of anarchism for example some such as benjamin tucker advocate privately funded institutions that defend individual liberty and property however other anarchists such as sir herbert read proudly accept the characterization utopian class character marxists have characterised anarchism as an expression of the class interests of the petite bourgeoisie or perhaps the lumpenproletariat see e g plekhanov for a marxist critique of one eight nine five anarchists have also been characterised as spoilt middle class dilettantes most recently in relation to anti capitalist protesters tacit authoritarianism in recent decades anarchism has been criticised by situationists post anarchists and others of preserving tacitly statist authoritarian or bureaucratic tendencies behind a dogmatic facade hypocrisy some critics point to the sexist and racist views of some prominent anarchists notably proudhon and bakunin as examples of hypocrisy inherent within anarchism while many anarchists however dismiss that the personal prejudices of one nine th century theorists influence the beliefs of present day anarchists others criticise modern anarchism for continuing to be eurocentric and reference the impact of anarchist thinkers like proudhon on fascism through groups like cercle proudhon anarcho capitalist bryan caplan argues that the treatment of fascists and suspected fascist sympathizers by spanish anarchists in the spanish civil war was a form of illegitimate coercion making the proffessed anarchists ultimately just a third faction of totalitarians alongside the communists and fascists he also criticizes the willingness of the cnt to join the statist republican government during the civil war and references stanley g payne s book on the franco regime which claims that the cnt entered negotiations with the fascist government six years after the war cultural phenomena noam chomsky one nine two eight the kind of anarchism that is most easily encountered in popular culture is represented by celebrities who publicly identify themselves as anarchists although some anarchists reject any focus on such famous living individuals as inherently litist the following figures are examples of prominent publicly self avowed anarchists the mit professor of linguistics noam chomsky the science fiction author ursula k le guin the social historian howard zinn entertainer and author hans alfredsson the avant garde artist nicol s rossell in denmark the freetown christiania was created in downtown copenhagen the housing and employment crisis in most of western europe led to the formation of communes and squatter movements like the one still thriving in barcelona in catalonia militant resistance to neo nazi groups in places like germany and the uprisings of autonomous marxism situationist and autonomist groups in france and italy also helped to give popularity to anti authoritarian non capitalist ideas in various musical styles anarchism rose in popularity most famous for the linking of anarchist ideas and music has been punk rock although in the modern age hip hop and folk music are also becoming important mediums for the spreading of the anarchist message in the uk this was associated with the punk rock movement the band crass is celebrated for its anarchist and pacifist ideas the dutch punk band the ex

social philosophy autism is classified as a neurodevelopmental disorder that manifests itself in markedly abnormal social interaction communication ability patterns of interests and patterns of behavior although the specific etiology of autism is unknown many researchers suspect that autism results from genetically mediated vulnerabilities to environmental triggers and while there is disagreement about the magnitude nature and mechanisms for such environmental factors researchers have found at least seven major genes prevalent among individuals diagnosed as autistic some estimate that autism occurs in as many as one united states child in one six six however the national institute of mental health gives a more conservative estimate of one in one zero zero zero for families that already have one autistic child the odds of a second autistic child may be as high as one in twenty diagnosis is based on a list of psychiatric criteria and a series of standardized clinical tests may also be used autism may not be physiologically obvious a complete physical and neurological evaluation will typically be part of diagnosing autism some now speculate that autism is not a single condition but a group of several distinct conditions that manifest in similar ways by definition autism must manifest delays in social interaction language as used in social communication or symbolic or imaginative play with onset prior to age three years according to the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders the icd one zero also says that symptoms must manifest before the age of three years there have been large increases in the reported incidence of autism for reasons that are heavily debated by researchers in psychology and related fields within the scientific community some children with autism have improved their social and other skills to the point where they can fully participate in mainstream education and social events but there are lingering concerns that an absolute cure from autism is impossible with current technology however many autistic children and adults who are able to communicate at least in writing are opposed to attempts to cure their conditions and see such conditions as part of who they are history dr hans asperger described a form of autism in the one nine four zero s that later became known as asperger s syndrome the word autism was first used in the english language by swiss psychiatrist eugene bleuler in a one nine one two number of the american journal of insanity it comes from the greek word for self however the classification of autism did not occur until the middle of the twentieth century when in one nine four three psychiatrist dr leo kanner of the johns hopkins hospital in baltimore reported on one one child patients with striking behavioral similarities and introduced the label early infantile autism he suggested autism from the greek autos meaning self to describe the fact that the children seemed to lack interest in other people although kanner s first paper on the subject was published in a now defunct journal the nervous child almost every characteristic he originally described is still regarded as typical of the autistic spectrum of disorders at the same time an austrian scientist dr hans asperger described a different form of autism that became known as asperger s syndrome but the widespread recognition of asperger s work was delayed by world war ii in germany and by the fact that his seminal paper wasn t translated into english for almost five zero years the majority of his work wasn t widely read until one nine nine seven thus these two conditions were described and are today listed in the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders dsm iv tr fourth edition text revision one as two of the five pervasive developmental disorders pdd more often referred to today as autism spectrum disorders asd all of these conditions are characterized by varying degrees of difference in communication skills social interactions and restricted repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior few clinicians today solely use the dsm iv criteria for determining a diagnosis of autism which are based on the absence or delay of certain developmental milestones many clinicians instead use an alternate means or a combination thereof to more accurately determine a diagnosis terminology when referring to someone diagnosed with autism the term autistic is often used however the term person with autism can be used instead this is referred to as person first terminology the autistic community generally prefers the term autistic for reasons that are fairly controversial this article uses the term autistic see talk page characteristics dr leo kanner introduced the label early infantile autism in one nine four three there is a great diversity in the skills and behaviors of individuals diagnosed as autistic and physicians will often arrive at different conclusions about the appropriate diagnosis much of this is due to the sensory system of an autistic which is quite different from the sensory system of other people since certain stimulations can affect an autistic differently than a non autistic and the degree to which the sensory system is affected varies wildly from one autistic person to another nevertheless professionals within pediatric care and development often look for early indicators of autism in order to initiate treatment as early as possible however some people do not believe in treatment for autism either because they do not believe autism is a disorder or because they believe treatment can do more harm than good social development typically developing infants are social beings early in life they do such things as gaze at people turn toward voices grasp a finger and even smile in contrast most autistic children prefer objects to faces and seem to have tremendous difficulty learning to engage in the give and take of everyday human interaction even in the first few months of life many seem indifferent to other people because they avoid eye contact and do not interact with them as often as non autistic children children with autism often appear to prefer being alone to the company of others and may passively accept such things as hugs and cuddling without reciprocating or resist attention altogether later they seldom seek comfort from others or respond to parents displays of anger or affection in a typical way research has suggested that although autistic children are attached to their parents their expression of this attachment is unusual and difficult to interpret parents who looked forward to the joys of cuddling teaching and playing with their child may feel crushed by this lack of expected attachment behavior children with autism appear to lack theory of mind the ability to see things from another person s perspective a behavior cited as exclusive to human beings above the age of five and possibly other higher primates such as adult gorillas chimpanzees and bonobos typical five year olds can develop insights into other people s different knowledge feelings and intentions interpretations based upon social cues e g gestures facial expressions an individual with autism seems to lack these interpretation skills an inability that leaves them unable to predict or understand other people s actions the social alienation of autistic and asperger s people is so intense from childhood that many of them have imaginary friends as companionship however having an imaginary friend is not necessarily a sign of autism and also occurs in non autistic children although not universal it is common for autistic people to not regulate their behavior this can take the form of crying or verbal outbursts that may seem out of proportion to the situation individuals with autism generally prefer consistent routines and environments they may react negatively to changes in them it is not uncommon for these individuals to exhibit aggression increased levels of self stimulatory behavior self injury or extensive withdrawal in overwhelming situations sensory system a key indicator to clinicians making a proper assessment for autism would include looking for symptoms much like those found in sensory integration dysfunction children will exhibit problems coping with the normal sensory input indicators of this disorder include oversensitivity or underreactivity to touch movement sights or sounds physical clumsiness or carelessness poor body awareness a tendency to be easily distracted impulsive physical or verbal behavior an activity level that is unusually high or low not unwinding or calming oneself difficulty learning new movements difficulty in making transitions from one situation to another social and or emotional problems delays in speech language or motor skills specific learning difficulties delays in academic achievement one common example is an individual with autism hearing a person with autism may have trouble hearing certain people while other people are louder than usual or the person with autism may be unable to filter out sounds in certain situations such as in a large crowd of people see cocktail party effect however this is perhaps the part of the autism that tends to vary the most from person to person so these examples may not apply to every autistic it should be noted that sensory difficulties although reportedly common in autistics are not part of the dsm iv diagnostic criteria for autistic disorder communication difficulties by age three typical children have passed predictable language learning milestones one of the earliest is babbling by the first birthday a typical toddler says words turns when he or she hears his or her name points when he or she wants a toy and when offered something distasteful makes it clear that the answer is no speech development in people with autism takes different paths some remain mute throughout their lives while being fully literate and able to communicate in other ways images sign language and typing are far more natural to them some infants who later show signs of autism coo and babble during the first few months of life but stop soon afterwards others may be delayed developing language as late as the teenage years still inability to speak does not mean that people with autism are unintelligent or unaware once given appropriate accommodations many will happily converse for hours and can often be found in online chat rooms discussion boards or websites and even using communication devices at autism community social events such as autreat those who do speak often use language in unusual ways retaining features of earlier stages of language development for long periods or throughout their lives some speak only single words while others repeat the same phrase over and over some repeat what they hear a condition called echolalia sing song repetitions in particular are a calming joyous activity that many autistic adults engage in many people with autism have a strong tonal sense and can often understand spoken language some children may exhibit only slight delays in language or even seem to have precocious language and unusually large vocabularies but have great difficulty in sustaining typical conversations the give and take of non autistic conversation is hard for them although they often carry on a monologue on a favorite subject giving no one else an opportunity to comment when given the chance to converse with other autistics they comfortably do so in parallel monologue taking turns expressing views and information just as neurotypicals people without autism have trouble understanding autistic body languages vocal tones or phraseology people with autism similarly have trouble with such things in people without autism in particular autistic language abilities tend to be highly literal people without autism often inappropriately attribute hidden meaning to what people with autism say or expect the person with autism to sense such unstated meaning in their own words the body language of people with autism can be difficult for other people to understand facial expressions movements and gestures may be easily understood by some other people with autism but do not match those used by other people also their tone of voice has a much more subtle inflection in reflecting their feelings and the auditory system of a person without autism often cannot sense the fluctuations what seems to non autistic people like a high pitched sing song or flat robot like voice is common in autistic children some autistic children with relatively good language skills speak like little adults rather than communicating at their current age level which is one of the things that can lead to problems since non autistic people are often unfamiliar with the autistic body language and since autistic natural language may not tend towards speech autistic people often struggle to let other people know what they need as anybody might do in such a situation they may scream in frustration or resort to grabbing what they want while waiting for non autistic people to learn to communicate with them people with autism do whatever they can to get through to them communication difficulties may contribute to autistic people becoming socially anxious or depressed repetitive behaviors although people with autism usually appear physically normal and have good muscle control unusual repetitive motions known as self stimulation or stimming may set them apart these behaviors might be extreme and highly apparent or more subtle some children and older individuals spend a lot of time repeatedly flapping their arms or wiggling their toes others suddenly freeze in position as children they might spend hours lining up their cars and trains in a certain way not using them for pretend play if someone accidentally moves one of these toys the child may be tremendously upset autistic children often need and demand absolute consistency in their environment a slight change in any routine in mealtimes dressing taking a bath or going to school at a certain time and by the same route can be extremely disturbing people with autism sometimes have a persistent intense preoccupation for example the child might be obsessed with learning all about vacuum cleaners train schedules or lighthouses often they show great interest in different languages numbers symbols or science topics repetitive behaviors can also extend into the spoken word as well perseveration of a single word or phrase even for a specific number of times can also become a part of the child s daily routine effects in education children with autism are affected with these symptoms every day these unusual characteristics set them apart from the everyday normal student because they have trouble understanding people s thoughts and feelings they have trouble understanding what their teacher may be telling them they do not understand that facial expressions and vocal variations hold meanings and may misinterpret what emotion their instructor is displaying this inability to fully decipher the world around them makes education stressful teachers need to be aware of a student s disorder so that they are able to help the student get the best out of the lessons being taught some students learn better with visual aids as they are better able to understand material presented this way because of this many teachers create visual schedules for their autistic students this allows the student to know what is going on throughout the day so they know what to prepare for and what activity they will be doing next some autistic children have trouble going from one activity to the next so this visual schedule can help to reduce stress research has shown that working in pairs may be beneficial to autistic children autistic students have problems in schools not only with language and communication but with socialization as well they feel self conscious about themselves and many feel that they will always be outcasts by allowing them to work with peers they can make friends which in turn can help them cope with the problems that arise by doing so they can become more integrated into the mainstream environment of the classroom a teacher s aide can also be useful to the student the aide is able to give more elaborate directions that the teacher may not have time to explain to the autistic child the aide can also facilitate the autistic child in such a way as to allow them to stay at a similar level to the rest of the class this allows a partially one on one lesson structure so that the child is still able to stay in a normal classroom but be given the extra help that they need there are many different techniques that teachers can use to assist their students a teacher needs to become familiar with the child s disorder to know what will work best with that particular child every child is going to be different and teachers have to be able to adjust with every one of them students with autism spectrum disorders typically have high levels of anxiety and stress particularly in social environments like school if a student exhibits aggressive or explosive behavior it is important for educational teams to recognize the impact of stress and anxiety preparing students for new situations by writing social stories can lower anxiety teaching social and emotional concepts using systematic teaching approaches such as the incredible five point scale or other cognitive behavioral strategies can increase a student s ability to control excessive behavioral reactions dsm definition autism is defined in section two nine nine zero zero of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders dsm iv as a total of six or more items from one two and three with at least two from one and one each from two and three qualitative impairment in social interaction as manifested by at least two of the following marked impairment in the use of multiple nonverbal behaviors such as eye to eye gaze facial expression body postures and gestures to regulate social interaction failure to develop peer relationships appropriate to developmental level a lack of spontaneous seeking to share enjoyment interests or achievements with other people e g by a lack of showing bringing or pointing out objects of interest lack of social or emotional'"

       "'margaret thatcher government in the uk saw deregulation as the cornerstone of contemporary economic conservatism thatcher added privatisation to this policy and privatised british airways with remarkable success and british rail with rather more mixed results she cut taxes especially on the upper income brackets and slowed governmental growth proponents of thatcherism attribute the unparalleled economic boom of the early one nine eight zero s to the late one nine nine zero s to these policies capitalism and the outcome of the free market may conflict with value conservatism at times as the communist manifesto emphasised capitalism and free markets have been profoundly subversive of the existing social order the bourgeoisie by the rapid improvement of all instruments of production by the immensely facilitated means of communication draws all even the most barbarian nations into civilisation the cheap prices of commodities are the heavy artillery with which it batters down all chinese walls with which it forces the barbarians intensely obstinate hatred of foreigners to capitulate it compels all nations on pain of extinction to adopt the bourgeois mode of production that economic system continues to conflict with traditional attitudes for instance in its massive distribution of pornography in many western countries so it is possible to be a value conservative without supporting market liberalism at present this is a common political stance in for example ireland and not all supporters of the free market are social conservatives fiscal conservatism is not a political philosophy and more a tradition of prudence in government spending and debt edmund burke in his reflections on the revolution in france articulated its principles it is to the property of the citizen and not to the demands of the creditor of the state that the first and original faith of civil society is pledged the claim of the citizen is prior in time paramount in title superior in equity the fortunes of individuals whether possessed by acquisition or by descent or in virtue of a participation in the goods of some community were no part of the creditor s security expressed or implied the public whether represented by a monarch or by a senate can pledge nothing but the public estate and it can have no public estate except in what it derives from a just and proportioned imposition upon the citizens at large in other words a government doesn t have the right to run up large debts and then throw the burden on the taxpayer the taxpayers right not to be taxed oppressively takes precedence even over paying back debts a government may have imprudently undertaken nature and the environment in early liberal philosophy nature and the environment were treated as a resource to be exploited value derived from their human use in accordance with the labor theory of value most early conservatives however saw the value of nature as inherent both strands have influenced conservative politics in many countries since the one nine th century the etymology emphasises the close correlation between the early conservation movement and conservative ideals in recent decades deep ecology has emerged as parallel non anthropocentric conservative philosophy with remarkable similarities in value preferences technological conservatism is often part of environmentalist philosophy rejecting especially the destructive effects on nature and ecosystems there is also a long tradition of technological scepticism in western culture usually directed against socially disruptive effects and potentially dangerous consequences the term conservatism is also used in the history of technology to describe the reluctance on grounds of cost effort and disruption to replace a functioning technology by another regional politics in western democracies conservative and right wing are often used interchangeably as near synonyms that is not always accurate but it has more than incidental validity certainly the opposition is in both cases the same the political left although left wing groups and individuals may have conservative social and cultural attitudes they are not generally accepted by self identified conservatives as part of the same movement on economic policy and the economic system conservatives and the right generally support the free market although less so in europe than in other places attitudes on some ethical and bio ethical issues such as opposition to abortion are accurately described as either right wing or conservative burkean conservatives favour incremental over radical change even from the right some conservatives distrust the xenophobic and even racist sentiments prominent on the political right protectionism and anti immigration policies may conflict with free market conservatives support for deregulation and free trade some conservatives oppose military interventionism inspired by early british conservative thinkers such as david hume and edmund burke burke saw imperialism as interfering with the traditions and organic make up of the colonised societies however it is equally true that there are numerous examples of theocratic religious conservatives conservative nationalists jingoist conservative imperialists and conservative racists and of respectable conservatives allied with them the conservative party in britain was a staunch defender of the british empire and was responsible for initial brutal repression of african decolonisation it is the degree of political taboo rather than inherent ideological incompatibility that determines the overlap between respectable conservatives and the right in european parliamentary systems conservatives currently ally with centrist groups or even some on the left rather than with the xenophobic populist right although critics have contended that the conservatives are taking in far right ideas for example in december two zero zero five le canard encha n claimed that nicolas sarkozy had implemented almost all of the far right front national fn measures proposed in its election program all mainstream parties in belgium cooperated to exclude the flemish separatist and xenophobic vlaams belang although some politicians wish to break this cordon sanitaire and the mainstream parties in france sometimes support each others candidates in run off elections where that is necessary to exclude the front national party however in march one nine seven seven and then in march one nine eight three fn was present on rpr udf lists at municipal elections in one nine eight eight rpr and udf right wing conservative parties allies with the fn in the bouches du rh ne and var regions in march one nine eight nine they had common lists in at least two eight cities of more than nine zero zero zero inhabitants those alliances were condemned in one nine nine one but a dozen conservative deputies gained fn s support in one nine nine seven north america see american conservatism for information on conservatism in the united states and canadian conservatism for information on conservatism in canada europe edmund burke is often considered the father of conservatism in anglo american circles in the united kingdom burkean conservatism continues on but its influence tended to leave its indelible mark on anglo american conservatism more so than british conservatism there is no organisational continuity amongst burkean conservatives which clearly connect them to contemporary conservatives in britain an old whig burke certainly was not the founder of the conservative party contemporary british conservatives may trace their roots to both the tories of canning and the early whigs who opposed the monarchy the tories who continued to represent the interests of the aristocracy in contrast to the whiggish mercantile class dominated british politics from the one seven seven zero s and the one eight three zero s burke the so called father of modern conservatism articulated a progressive conservative position through the whig party and was against the entrenched system of patronage and government favor for the wealthy classes nominally the modern british conservative party was founded out of the tory party by sir robert peel in the one eight four zero s splitting almost immediately over the issue of protectionism the anti protectionist faction joined with some whigs and radicals to form the liberal coalition which was to dominate politics for much of the rest of the nineteenth century a liberal conservative coalition during the first world war coupled with the assent of the labour party hastened the collapse of the liberals in the one nine two zero s after the second world war the conservative party made concessions to the socialist policies of the left this compromise was a pragmatic measure to regain power but also the result of the early successes of central planning and state ownership forming a cross party consensus however in the one nine eight zero s under the leadership of margaret thatcher the party returned to classical liberal economic ideas and privatization of many state enterprises was ordained for more detail see history of the conservative party in other parts of europe mainstream conservatism is often represented by the christian democratic parties they form the bulk of the european peoples party fraction in the european parliament the origin of these parties is usually in catholic parties of the late one nine th and early two zero th century and catholic social doctrine was their original inspiration over the years conservatism gradually became their main ideological inspiration and they generally became less catholic the german cdu its bavarian sister party csu and the dutch cda are protestant catholic parties in the nordic countries conservatism has been represented in liberal conservative parties like the moderate party in sweden and the conservative people s party in denmark domestically these parties generally support market oriented policies and usually gain support from the business community and white collar professionals internatially they generally support the european union and a strong defense their views on social issues tend to be more liberal than for example the u s republican party social conservatism in the nordic coutries are often found in their christian democratic parties in several of the nordic countries right wing populist parties have gained some support since the seven zero s their policies have often been focuesd on tax cuts reduced immigration and tougher law and order policies generally one could claim that european conservatives tend to be more moderate on many social and economic issues compared to american conservatives they tend to be quite friendly to the aims of the welfare state although concerned about a healthy business environment some groups however have been more supportive of a stricter libertarian or laissez faire agenda especially under influence from thatcherism european conservative groups often see themselves as guardians of prudence moderation history and tried experience as opposed to radicalism and social experiments appraisal of high culture and established political institutions like the monarchy is often found in european conservatism mainstream conservative groups are often staunch supportes of the european union however one might also found elements of nationalism in many countries one nation thatcherism gaullism china chinese conservatism is based on the teachings of kung fu tze confucius confucius who was living in a time of chaos and warring kingdoms wrote extensively about the importance of the family of social stability and of obedience to just authority his ideas continue to permeate chinese society traditional chinese conservatism imbued with confucian thought have been resurgent in recent years despite more than a half century of authoritarian marxist leninist rule after mao s death in one nine seven six three factions wrestled to succeed him the hardline maoists who wanted to continue the revolutionary mobilization restorationists who advocated a return to the soviet model of communism and reformers led by deng xiaoping who hoped to reduce the role of ideology in government and overhaul the economy traditional chinese values have surged rather assertively in spite of the longstanding revolutionary communist regime today the chinese communist party is run by technocrats who seek stability and economic progress while suppressing free speech and religion the party is seen by some as the recipient of the mandate of heaven a traditional chinese idea the communist party is taming itself and no longer consistently advocates marxist revolutionary theory adhering instead to a certain ideological flexibility consistent with the dictum of deng xiaoping that is seek truth from facts love of country and national pride has been resurgent as well as traditionalism chinese nationalism tends to speak highly of a centralized powerful chinese state the government is attempting to win and maintain the loyalty of both its own citizens as well as that of recently departed overseas chinese recent bestseller china can say no expresses a sentiment in favor of a uniquely chinese path that tellingly does not have to involve american norms such as individualism and western liberalism moreover the tide may still be coming in for chinese nationalism as the next generation of chinese leaders will have

internal divisions along ethnic religious or linguistic lines yet nonetheless manages to remain stable due to consultation among the elites of each of its major social groups consociational states are often contrasted with states with majority rule classical examples of consociational states are belgium switzerland lebanon india and the netherlands consociational polities often have these characteristics coalition cabinets where executive power is shared between parties not concentrated in one many of these cabinets are oversized they include parties not necessary for a parliamentary majority balance of power between executive and legislative decentralized and federal government where regional minorities have considerable independence asymmetric bicameralism where it is very difficult for one party to gain a majority in both houses normally one chamber represents regional interests and the other national interests proportional representation to allow small minorities to gain representation too organized and corporatist interest groups which represent minorities a rigid constitution which prevents government from changing the constitution without consent of minorities judicial review which allow minorities to go to the courts to seek redress against laws that they see as unjust elements of direct democracy which allow minorities to enact or prevent legislation proportional employment in the public sector a neutral head of state either a monarch with only a ceremonial duties or an indirectly elect president who gives up party affiliation after his election referenda are only used to allow minorities to block legislation this means that they must be a citizen s initiative and that there is no compulsory voting equality between ministers in cabinet the prime minister is only the primus inter pares an independent central bank where experts and not politicians set out monetary policies in this view switzerland a country with considerable minorities is a prime example of such a consensus democracy examples of this include the frequent use of referenda its confederal structure and the tradition that all large parties are included in the cabinet creating oversized coalition governments this can be directly linked to the many minorities switzerland has its population consists of both protestants and catholics and french german italian and romansch speaking groups the eu too can be seen as a consensus democracy the parliament is bicameral one chamber the european parliament is directly elected the other the european council consists of national ministers the executive the european commission is very weak in comparison to the legislature especially the european council the commission could be seen as an oversized coalition including nearly all parties in parliament see also confederation federation consensus democracy forms of government politics society classical liberalism also called classic liberalism or simply liberalism is the original form of and is today a tendency within liberalism it is a political school of thought that first emerged in the one seven th and one eight th centuries upholding individualism and free market economics classical liberalism focuses on concepts of individual autonomy and private property and argues that the sole legitimate function of government is to defend these classical liberals promote the use of precisely delineated constitutions that are difficult or impossible to modify intended to prevent governments from assuming an interventionist role the term classical liberalism was coined in the two zero th century to refer to the general philosophy espoused by pre one eight five zero liberals the term refers to the philosophy itself rather than being time specific the term was coined to avoid confusion with a modern definition of liberalism which does not accept the minimal statism philosophy american liberalism is a key example of this modern libertarianism is seen by some historians as a revival of the original doctrine of liberalism and libertarians often call themselves classical liberals interchangeably likewise those who call themselves classical liberals are sometimes referred to as libertarians introduction the classic liberal philosophy places a particular emphasis on the sovereignty of the individual with private property rights being seen as essential to individual liberty it forms the philosophical basis for laissez faire philosophy the precepts of classic liberalism were probably best described by john locke and adam smith and illuminated much of the thought at the time of the american revolution as a result the united states constitution and the united states declaration of independence are both documents that embody many principles of classic liberalism modern liberalism tends to deviate from this definition of the term liberal in that it espouses support of the use of the power of government to achieve a variety of desirable goals ranging from social justice to economic equality the term classical liberalism is often used interchangeably with the term libertarianism raimondo cubeddu of the department of political science of the university of pisa says it is often difficult to distinguish between libertarianism and classical liberalism those two labels are used almost interchangeably by those who we may call libertarians of a minarchist persuasion scholars who following locke and nozick believe a state is needed in order to achieve effective protection of property rights the cato institute briefly discusses these changes and their views on the term classical liberalism stating from their website classical liberal is a bit closer to the mark but the word classical connotes a backward looking philosophy finally liberal may well be the perfect word in most of the world the liberals in societies from china to iran to south africa to argentina are supporters of human rights and free markets but its meaning has clearly been corrupted by contemporary american liberals thus the cato institute sees classical liberals liberals and libertarians being from the same ideological family classical liberals like those within the cato institute often prefer to call themselves liberals because they see themselves as the only rightful inheritors of liberalism amy h sturgis ph d an expert in intellectual history says the rise decline and reemergence of classical liberalism that classical liberalism includes the following an ethical emphasis on the individual as a rights bearer prior to the existence of any state community or society the support of the right of property carried to its economic conclusion a free market system the desire for a limited constitutional government to protect individuals rights from others and from its own expansion the universal global and ahistorical applicability of these above convictions origins classical liberalism is a political and economic philosophy with roots in ancient greek and medieval thought it received an early expression in the one six th century by the school of salamanca in spain and its classic formulation in the enlightenment tradition the wealth of nations one seven seven six by scottish philosopher adam smith is one of the classic works that rejects the philosophy of mercantilism which advocated state interventionism in the economy and protectionism the classical liberals saw mercantalism as enriching privileged elites at the expense of well being of the populace another early expression is the tradition of a nordic school of liberalism set in motion by a finnish parliamentarian anders chydenius classical liberalism tries to circumscribe the limits of political power and to define and support individual liberty and private property the phrase is often used as a means of delineating the older philosophy called liberalism from modern liberalism in order to avoid semantic confusion adam smith classic liberalism is close to one eight th century liberalism the wealth of nations one seven seven six by adam smith is considered one of the classic foundations of liberalism while adam smith provides an explanation of liberalism and economics the legal and philosophical understanding originates with scholars like john locke and evolves through thomas jefferson and james madison immanuel kant in the perpetual peace creates an international liberal framework to foster a sustainable world peace the term liberal derived from this time period generally the one eight th and one nine th century with its origination stemming from the belief in individual freedom economic freedom including free markets and limited representative government this original understanding of the word liberal carries the same meaning in a few countries but in most countries the meaning and ideology behind liberalism differ to certain degrees e g social security tariffs intervention and regulation into the economy wage and price controls from its meaning in the eighteenth century in many countries liberalism holds a position between classical liberalism and american liberalism only a few major parties adhere to classical liberalism most of the liberal parties accept limited government intervention in economics immanuel kant classic liberals include all original liberals such as john locke adam smith david ricardo thomas jefferson james madison john stuart mill with his work on liberty and even more modern liberals such as von mises hayek and milton friedman classical liberal institutions include the frasier institute canada the hoover institution stanford university and the cato institute to name a few classical liberal philosophy classical liberals subscribe to a very basic and universal understanding of the world and the rights of all humans classical liberals believe in private property free markets economic competition freedom from coercion limited government all economic freedom the rule of law and individual rights natural rights is also used these principals apply to all people of all faiths cultures societies ethnicities and histories and it is stated that all peoples are capable of achieving liberal government and liberal societies not just western cultures classical liberals prefer a laissez faire style of government with a microeconomic focus and understanding of economic operations classical liberals reject wealth transfers though admire the goal of helping the needy tariffs or other trade barriers such as quotas regulated markets also known as a mixed economy capital controls and wage and price controls as a general rule these macroeconomic policies are considered by them as reducing the general welfare of society social security and tariffs for example are viewed by milton friedman as perverse wealth transfers meaning wealth transfers from poor to rich hayek and friedman also believed that economic freedom would help build and protect political and civil freedoms while a loss in economic freedom meant a loss in civil and political freedoms milton friedman s free to choose and capitalism and freedom are examples of this philosophy updated for modern man and woman to understand classical liberalism key thinkers below is a list of key liberal thinkers as liberalism developed and maintained a laissez faire political economic outlook john locke locke s major works a letter concerning toleration and two treatises of government were both published in one six eight nine collectively they argue for greater religious toleration and for a state that respects the natural laws laid down in a social contract immanuel kant kant further advanced the idea of a liberal peace by demonstrating conditions and requisistes for international peace among states in his work the perpetual peace the founding fathers adam smith adam smith believed that the government had only three and only three roles to play one protecting the society from the violence and invasion of other independent societies which can only be performed by means of a military force two protecting as far as possible every member of the society from the injustice or oppression of every other member of it and three erecting and maintaining those public institutions and those public works which though most advantageious are such that the profit could never repay the expense to any individual or small group of indviduals which implies that governments should work to correct market externalities but smith did not argue for government run monopolies to permanently solve externality problems jeremy bentham john stuart mill quote from on liberty one eight five nine the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community against his will is to prevent harm to others his own good either physical or moral is not sufficient warrant john stuart mill joeseph schumpeter according to political scientist michael doyle schumpeter advanced and modernized smith s economic assesment of capitalisms role in creating peaceful relations among states in his work the sociology of imperialism ludwig heinrich edler von mises friedrich von hayek hayek was a contemporary though friendly critic of john maynard keynes and believed that the outcomes of keynes interventionist policies would result in the destruction of civil liberal society he further demonstrated this thesis in his work the road to serfdom arguing that restrictions among economic freedom result in a loss of civil and political freedom milton friedman economically friedman is known for his monetarist and shock therapy theories friedman like hayek believed that economic freedom created and protected civil and political freedom and that the loss of economic freedom lead to a loss in civil and political freedom his most famous popular works include capitalism and freedom and free to choose where he advances the ideas of laissez faire free market liberal government classical liberalism and the great depression classical liberals including friedrich august von hayek milton friedman and ludwig von mises argued that the great depression was not a result of laissez faire capitalism but a result of too much government intervention and regulation upon the market in friedman s work capitalism and freedom he elucidated government regulation that occurred before the great depression including heavy regulations upon banks that prevented them he argued from reacting to the markets demand for money furthermore the u s federal government had created a fixed currency pegged to the value of gold this pegged value created a massive surplus of gold but later the pegged value was too low which created a massive migration of gold from the u s friedman and hayek both believed that this inability to react to currency demand created a run on the banks that the banks stifled by state unit banking laws were no longer able to handle and that and the fixed exchange rates between the dollar and gold both worked to cause the great depression by creating and then not fixing deflationary pressures he further argued in this thesis that the government caused more pain upon the american public by first raising taxes then by printing money to pay debts thus causing inflation the combination of which helped to wipe out the savings of the middle class others note that the rising tariffs and reduced trade and export industries and helped slow economic growth the smoot hawley tariff act passed in the summer of one nine three zero is regarded by some free market scholars as an important variable in worsening economic conditions at the onset of the depression some economists since milton friedman have continued to argue that the causes of this great depression have been erased by populist myths from keynesians and leftists in an attempt to legitimize their own economic prefrences at the expense of the truth liberalism against totalitarianism liberalism always defined itself as the freedom from arbitrary tyranny or totalitarianism which had become the prevelant alternative to liberalism the term was first used by giovanni gentile to describe the socio political system set up by mussolini stalin would apply it to german nazi ism and after the war it became a descriptive term for the common characteristics of fascist and marxist leninist regimes totalitarian regimes sought and tried to implement absolute centralized control over all aspects of society in order to achieve prosperity and stability such governments often justified such absolutism by arguing that the survival of their civilization was at risk opposition to totalitarian regimes acquired great importance in liberal and democratic thinking and totalitarian regimes were often portrayed as trying to destroy liberal democracy in italy and germany nationalist governments linked corporate capitalism to the state and promoted the idea that their nations were culturally and racially superior and that conquest would give them their rightful place in the sun the propaganda machines of these totalitarian states argued that democracy was weak and incapable of decisive action and that only a strong leader could impose necessary discipline the rise of totalitarianism became a lens for liberal thought many liberals began to analyze their own beliefs and principles and came to the conclusion that totalitarianism arose because people in a degraded condition turn to dictatorships for solutions from this it was argued that the state had the duty to protect the economic well being of its citizens as isaiah berlin said freedom for the wolves means death for the sheep this growing body of liberal thought argued that reason requires a government to act as a balancing force in economics hayek in his book the road to serfdom believed that the rise of totalitarian regimes whether they be communist fascist or nazi were the result of the restriction of economic freedom economic freedom was thus restricted by government intervention and regulation of the economy hayek states economic planning conducted independently on a national scale are bound in the aggregate effect to be harmful even from a purely economic point of view and in addition to produce serious international friction that there is little hope of international order or lasting peace so long as every country is free to employ whatever measures it desires in its own immediate interest however damaging they may be to others hayek f a the road to serfdom the university of chicago press one nine four four p two four zero here hayek is demonstrating the rationale behind why economic policies like those subscribed to by keynesian economists can not and could not be compatible to freedom and peace much in the same way nazis fascists and communists failed to retain or create free and peaceful states the more economic freedom that was lost he said the more civil and political freedom would be lost as well hayek argued against these keynesian institutions believing that they can and will lead to the same totalitarian governments keynesians were attempting to avoid hayek saw authoritarian regimes such as the fascist nazis and communists as the same totalitarian branch that sought the elimination of economic freedom to him the elimination of economic freedom brought about the elimination of political freedom thus the differences between nazis and communists are only rhetorical the same outcomes could occur in britain or anywhere else if the state sought to control the economic freedom of the individual with the policy prescriptions outlined by people like dewey keynes or roosevelt h hayek also saw these economic controls being instituted in the united kingdom and the united states and warned against these keynesian institutions believing that they can and will lead to the same totalitarian governments keynesians liberals were attempting to avoid nobel prize winning economists such as hayek and milton friedman have argued for years that economic freedom leads to greater political and civil rights and those governments who control the economy tend to limit economic rights and eventually will limit political civil rights of their people friedman states economic freedom is simply a requisite for political freedom by enabling people to cooperate with one another without coercion or central direction it reduces the area over which political power is exercised friedman milton and rose friedman free to choose a personal statement harcort brace janovich one nine eight zero p two three friedrich von hayek and milton friedman stated that economic freedom is a necessary condition for the creation and sustainability of civil and political freedoms hayek believed the same totalitarian outcomes could occur in britain or anywhere else if the state sought to control the economic freedom of the individual with the policy prescriptions outlined by people like dewey keynes or roosevelt classical liberal studies by the canadian conservative free market oriented fraser institute the american conservative free market oriented heritage foundation and the wall street journal state that there is a relationship between economic freedom and political and civil freedoms to the extent claimed by friedrich von hayek they agree with hayek that those countries which restrict economic freedom ultimately restrict civil and political freedoms classical liberalism and freedom the major tenenat of liberalism remains freedom of the individual from coersion and tyranny friedrich von hayek and milton friedman stated that economic freedom is a necessary condition for the creation and sustainability of civil and political freedoms hayek believed the same totalitarian outcomes could occur in britain or anywhere else if the state sought to control the economic freedom of the individual with the policy prescriptions outlined by people like dewey keynes or roosevelt classical liberal studies by the canadian conservative fraser institute the american conservative heritage foundation and the wall street journal argue that there is in fact a relationship between economic freedom and political and civil freedoms as friedrich von hayek had once said they agree with hayek s statement that those countries which restrict economic freedom ultimately restrict civil and political freedoms on the other hand economic freedom does not necesarily imply civil and political freedom f a hayek and milton friedman have both observed that economic freedom is a necessary condition for the creation and sustainability of civil and political freedoms a link between a lack of economic freedom and human rights violation has been observed over the last century easily seen by the atrocities committed by the least economically free countries in the world which include nazi germany soviet russia communist china khmer rouge cambodia hayek believed the same totalitarian outcomes could occur in britain or anywhere else if the state sought to control the economic freedom of the individual with the policy prescriptions outlined by people like dewey john m keynes or franklin d roosevelt the facts of history in the post war era affirmed in his vision the accuracy of his thesis clement atlee s labour party after winning a land slide election in post world war ii england encouraged private business owners to hand over their property nationalized many industries instituted wage and price controls and even attempted to place restrictions on their citizens ability to seek employment at will by requiring citizens to seek permission from the central government another example in the one nine six zero s the labour government of harold wilson placed a limit of three zero on money people could take abroad to avoid the consequences of an inflatonary policy pursued to create full employment nevertheless british democratic institutions survived and in one nine seven nine a radical conservative government led by margaret thatcher was elected which sometimes painfully re liberalised the economy recent empirical studies by the frasier institute heritage foundation and the wall street journal argued that there is in fact a relationship between economic freedom and political and civil freedoms as friedrich von hayek had once observed as he stated those countries which restrict economic freedom ultimately restrict civil and political freedoms http www

policy to combat stagflation which plagued the united states many small liberal gains were achieved under ronald reagan in the one nine eight zero s as liberalism gained steam world wide but the country continued to mount a national debt because of an imbalanced budget the democrats under bill clinton took things a little further balancing the u s budget creating nafta and influencing the birth of the gatt nine four wto all of which helped usher in a prosperous decade for the united states the current president bush has been accused of only verbally supporting free and open markets while continuing to mount public debt and even raising trade barriers to protect the american steel industry despite some strides toward liberalism the changes made have been small to the point where some argue that neither the democrats nor the republicans maintain political platforms that reflect classical liberalism even though segments of both parties argue for less free trade and more managed trade the libertarian party is an example of a party in the united states that wholeheartedly supports classical liberalism within the united states classical liberalism is rhetorically confused with conservatism the cato institute a think tank known for its advocation of classical liberalism in government states from its website only in america do people seem to refer to free market capitalism the most progressive dynamic and ever changing system the world has ever known as conservative additionally many contemporary american conservatives favor state intervention in some areas most notably in trade and into our private lives many classical liberals argue that modern liberalism as it is practiced is mostly rhetorical lip service to liberalism s highest ideals of freedom rather than a function of its basic assumptions the free market see liberalism for further understanding classical liberalism versus modern or social liberalism the industrial revolution greatly increased material wealth but made social problems more visible such as pollution child labor and overcrowding in the cities material and scientific progress led to greater longevity and a reduced mortality rate the population increased dramatically the downside of this was an oversupply of labor which led to declining wages economic liberals such as john locke adam smith and wilhelm von humboldt felt that the problems of an industrial society would correct themselves without government intervention in the one nine th century the voting franchise in most liberal democracies was extended and these newly enfranchised citizens often voted in favor of government solutions to the problems they faced in their everyday lives a rapid increase in literacy and the spread of knowledge led to social activism in a variety of forms social liberals demanded laws against child labor and laws requiring minimum standards of worker safety and a minimum wage the laissez faire economic liberals countered that such laws were an unjust imposition on life liberty and property not to mention a hindrance to economic development thus began the struggle on the one hand economic liberals who stress economic freedom and desire small governments on the other hand social liberals who stress equality of opportunity and desire a government large enough to protect citizens from the consequences of economic or natural difficulties that they consider too serious to be overcome without government aid this one nine th century social liberalism was the first significant split from classical liberalism according to milton friedman beginning in the late nineteenth century and especially after one nine three zero in the united states the term liberalism came to be associated with a very different emphasisis particularly in economic policy it came to be associated with a readiness to rely primarily on the state rather than on private voluntary arrangements to acheive objectives regarded as desirable the catchwords became welfare and equality rather than freedom the nineteenth century liberal regarded an extension of freedom as the most effective way to promote welfare and equality the tweentieth century liberal regards welfare and equality as either prerequisistes of or alternatives to freedom in the name of welfare and equality the twentieth century liberal has come to favor a revival of the very policies of state intervention and paternalism against which classical liberalism fought in the very act of turning the clock back to seventeenth century merchantalism he is fond of castigating true liberals as reactionary by the end of the one nine th century a growing body of liberal thought asserted that in order to be free individuals needed access to the requirements of fulfillment including protection from exploitation and education in one nine one one l t hobhouse published liberalism which summarized the new liberalism including qualified acceptance of government intervention in the economy and the collective right to equality in dealings what he called just consent today so called modern liberalism has been conglomerated with socialism classical liberals believe that liberal philosophy is supposed to support the overall expansion of freedom in all areas they most especially disagree with modern liberals and their embracing of stances that are inherently about taking away freedoms such as gun control affirmative action high taxation involuntary social security campaign finance reform and opposition to school choice in hayek s book the constitution of liberty in the chapter why i am not a conservative hayek explains to his readers that he was not a conservative because he is a liberal and had refused to give up that label in the united states the term liberal had changed meaning and according to hayek this was because franklin d roosevelt had been labeled a socialist and a leftist because of his new deal policies fearing the consequences of that label fdr called himself a liberal instead since that day liberal in the united states has had a different meaning from the original one eight th and one nine th century meaning of the word people who stayed close to this original meaning label themselves often classic liberal classical liberal or libertarian to avoid confusion especially in america discusing the difference between classical liberalism as the original meaning of liberalism and modern liberalism joeseph schumpeter states as a supreme if unintended compliment the enemies of the system of private enterprise have thought it wise to appropriate its label implying that modern liberals have stolen the word and given it a definition opposite of its original meaning classical liberalism and libertarianism libertarians may describe themselves as classical liberals but not all classical liberals will describe themselves as libertarians libertarians do share many philisophical political and economic undertones with classical liberalism including the ideas of laissez faire government free markets and individual freedom classical liberals understood that in order to protect individual liberty the government must be limited in what it can do the libertarian party takes this classical liberal understanding alittle further by arguing for greater restrictions upon the government while the libertarian party opposes any government funding of education classical liberals such as j s mill and milton friedman have favored government funded vouchers for basic schooling where the libertarians want no subsidies at all for private firms the eminent classical liberal friedrich hayek acknowledges that some subsidies may be justified for the general good of society but never for the good of the firm in question and never merely for the purpose of redistributing income while the capital l libertarians want to leave the provision of minimum sustenance for the poor or disabled entirely to private charity classical liberals often support residual social welfare benefits friedman proposed a negative income tax which establishes a minimum income and hayek favored a government role in ensuring minimum food and shelter for all finally while some libertarians tend toward a near absolute sanctity of contract and private property hayek was open to the regulation of monopolies in some cases mainly by requiring them to treat all customers equally and generally opposed contracts in restraint of trade including the use of unions as labor cartels criticism of libertarian as classical liberalism the modern traditions of libertarianism and neoliberalism claim the ideological inheritance of classical liberalism however many object to this blending of what they see as two separate opposing philosophies katz two zero zero three samuel freeman states that that libertarianism s resemblance to liberalism is superficial in the end libertarians reject essential liberal institutions correctly understood libertarianism resembles a view that liberalism historically defined itself against the doctrine of private political power that underlies feudalism like feudalism libertarianism conceives of justified political power as based in a network of private contracts it rejects the idea essential to liberalism that political power is a public power to be be impartially exercised for the common good those who emphasize the distinction between classical liberalism and libertarianism argue that libertarianism and liberalism are fundamentally incompatible because the checks and

on the island of cyprus a group of cats is referred to as a clowder while a male cat is called a tom and a female is called a queen or quean an immature cat is called a kitten which is also an alternate name for young rats rabbits hedgehogs beavers and squirrels in medieval england kitten was interchangeable with catling a cat whose ancestry is formally registered is called a purebred cat a pedigree cat or a show cat although not all show cats are pedigree or purebred in strict terms a purebred cat is one whose ancestry contains only individuals of the same breed a pedigree cat is one whose ancestry is recorded but may have ancestors of different breeds purebreds are less than one percent of the total feline population cats of mixed ancestry are referred to as domestic longhairs and domestic shorthairs or commonly as random bred moggies mongrels mutt cats or alley cats the ratio of pedigree purebred cats to random bred cats varies from country to country there are dozens of breeds of domestic cats some hairless or tailless and they exist in a variety of different colors they are skilled predators and have been known to hunt over one thousand different species for food they are also intelligent animals some are able to manipulate simple mechanisms such as lever handled doors and flush toilets they communicate by calling meow miaou purring hissing growling and gesturing because the domestication of the cat is relatively recent cats may also still live effectively in the wild often forming small colonies the cat s association with humans leads it to figure prominently in the mythology and legends of several cultures including the ancient egyptians vikings and chinese characteristics physical a cat grooming itself cats typically weigh between two five and seven kg five five one six lb however some breeds such as the maine coon can exceed one one three kg two five pounds some have been known to reach up to two three kg five zero lb due to overfeeding this is very unhealthy for the cat and should be prevented through diet and exercise playing especially for cats living exclusively indoors in captivity indoor cats typically live one four to two zero years though the oldest known cat lived to age three six domestic cats tend to live longer if they are not permitted to go outdoors reducing the risk of injury from fights or accidents and if they are spayed or neutered spaying and neutering a cat also decreases the risk of testicular and ovarian cancer and female cats spayed before their first heat or litter benefit from reduced risk of mammary cancer feral cats living in modern urban environments often live only two years or less feral cats in maintained colonies can live much longer the british cat action trust reported a one nine year old feral female the oldest feral cat was mark who was maintained by the british charity cats protection and who reached two six years of age thirty two individual muscles in the ear allow for a manner of directional hearing the cat can move each ear independently of the other thus a cat can move its body in one direction and point its ears in quite another direction such as pointing backward toward its owner most cats have straight ears pointing upward unlike dogs flap eared breeds are extremely rare scottish folds are one such exceptional genetic mutation when angry or frightened a cat will lay its ears back to accompany the growling or hissing sounds it makes cats conserve energy by sleeping more than most animals especially as they grow older daily durations of sleep are various usually one two one six hours with one three one four being the average some cats can sleep as much as two zero hours in a two four hour period the term cat nap refers to the cat s ability to fall asleep for a brief period someone who nods off for a few minutes is said to be taking a cat nap due to their nocturnal nature cats are often known to enter a period of increased hyperactivity and playfulness during the evening dubbed the evening crazies or night crazies by some the temperament of a cat can vary depending on the breed and socialization shorter haired cats tend to be skinnier and more active while cats with longer hair tend to be heavier and less active the normal body temperature of a cat is between three eight and three nine c one zero one and one zero two

on how excited the cat is for a cat at rest the average heart rate should be between one five zero and one eight zero bpm depending upon level of activity a popular belief holds that cats always land on their feet they do usually but not always during a fall a cat can reflexively twist its body and right itself using its acute sense of balance and flexibility it always rights itself in the same way provided it has the time to do so during a fall certain breeds that don t have a tail are a notable exception since a cat moves its tail and relies on conservation of angular momentum to set up for landing cats like dogs are digitigrades they walk directly on their toes the bones of their feet making up the lower part of the visible leg they are capable of walking very precisely placing each hind paw directly in the print of the corresponding forepaw minimising noise and visible tracks senses a close up of a cat s eye measuring the senses of any animal can be difficult because there is usually no explicit communication e g reading aloud the letters of a snellen chart between the subject and the tester while a cat s senses of smell and hearing may not be as keen as say those of a mouse they are superior in many ways to those of humans these along with the cat s highly advanced eyesight taste and touch receptors make the cat extremely sensitive among mammals sight testing indicates that a cat s vision is superior at night in comparison to humans and inferior in daylight cats like dogs have a tapetum lucidum that reflects extra light to the retina while this enhances the ability to see in low light it appears to reduce net visual acuity thus detracting when light is abundant in very bright light the slit like iris closes very narrowly over the eye reducing the amount of light on the sensitive retina and improving depth of field the tapetum and other mechanisms give the cat a minimum light detection threshold up to seven times lower than that of humans variation in color of cats eyes in flash photographs is largely due to the interaction of the flash with the tapetum average cats have a visual field of view estimated at two zero zero versus one eight zero in humans with a binocular field overlap in the images from each eye narrower than that of humans as with most predators their eyes face forward affording depth perception at the expense of field of view field of view is largely dependent upon the placement of the eyes but may also be related to the eye s construction instead of the fovea which gives humans sharp central vision cats have a central band known as the visual streak cats can apparently differentiate among colors especially at close range but without appreciable subtlety cats have a third eyelid the nictitating membrane which is a thin cover that closes from the side and appears when the cat s eyelid opens this membrane partially closes if the cat is sick although in a sleepy content cat this membrane is often visible if a cat chronically shows the third eyelid it should be taken to a veterinarian hearing humans and cats have a similar range of hearing on the low end of the scale but cats can hear much higher pitched sounds even better than dogs cats can hear two octaves higher than humans and one half octave higher than dogs when listening for something a cat s ears will swivel in that direction a cat s ear flaps pinnae can independently point backwards as well as forwards and sideways to pinpoint the source of the sound cats can judge within three inches seven five cm the location of a sound being made one yard approximately one meter away smell a domestic cat s sense of smell is about fourteen times stronger than a human s cats have twice as many smell sensitive cells in their noses as people do which means they can smell things we are not even aware of cats also have a scent organ in the roof of their mouths called the vomeronasal or jacobson s organ when a cat wrinkles its muzzle lowers its chin and lets its tongue hang a bit it is opening the passage to the vomeronasal this is called gaping gaping is the equivalent of the flehmen response in other animals such as dogs and horses a cat using its senses for exploration touch cats generally have about a dozen whiskers in four rows on each upper lip a few on each cheek tufts over the eyes and bristles on the chin whiskers may also be found on the cat s elbows and there are similar hairs comprising the cat s eyebrows the sphynx a nearly hairless breed may have full length short or no whiskers at all whiskers technically called vibrissae can aid with navigation and sensation whiskers may detect very small shifts in air currents enabling a cat to know it is near obstructions without actually seeing them the upper two rows of whiskers can move independently from the lower two rows for even more precise measuring it is thought that a cat may choose to rely on the whiskers in dim light where fully dilating the pupils would reduce its ability to focus on close objects the whiskers also spread out roughly as wide as the cat s body making it able to judge if it can fit through an opening whiskers are also an indication of the cat s attitude whiskers point forward when the cat is inquisitive and friendly and lie flat on the face when the cat is being defensive or aggressive taste according to national geographic december eight cats cannot taste sugary foods due to a faulty sweet receptor gene some scientists believe this is related to the cat s diet being naturally high in protein though it is unclear whether it is the cause or the result of it communication a cat vocalizing the unique sound a small cat makes is written onomatopoeically as meow in american english meow or miaow in british
